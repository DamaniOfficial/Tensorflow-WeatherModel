# Tensorflow-WeatherModel

I trained an instance of Tensorflow Keras' VGG16 model based on 1500 images of 5 different types/classes of weather â€“ Cloudy, Rainy, Sunny (Shine), Sunrise, and Foggy.

I have included the code that I used to train the model and test the model -- DID NOT INCLUDE the weights for VGG16

# Tensorflow-WeatherModel

I trained an instance of Tensorflow Keras' VGG16 model based on 1500 images of 5 different types/classes of weather â€“ Cloudy, Rainy, Sunny (Shine), Sunrise, and Foggy.

I have included the code that I used to train the model and test the model, the weights for VGG16, and the saved model (after 10 epochs of training and validation) for you to test out accuracy with new images...
